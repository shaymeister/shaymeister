## 🔬 Shay Snyder

PhD Researcher | Embedded & Low-Power Machine Learning | Brain-Inspired Systems

I am a PhD researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at George Mason University, working at the intersection of embedded machine learning, brain-inspired algorithms, and autonomous systems.

My work focuses on developing efficient, hardware-aware representations and learning methods that operate under real-world constraints such as limited power, latency, bandwidth, and sensing reliability. I am particularly interested in approaches that bridge biological inspiration and deployable engineering, enabling intelligent systems that are robust, interpretable, and scalable.
